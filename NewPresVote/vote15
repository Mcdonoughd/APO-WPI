Hi,
	I'm writing to nominate Jason Hudson for President. although,
hudson is young, I am confident in his ability to learn the role of the
president quickly. He is fully of energy and very vocal; two things that
are very important for a leadership position such as this.  In my opinion,
Hudson embodies the unselfish spirit of apo. His willingness to take on
tasks, and step up and take charge will make him an excellent choice. I
urge you vote for hudson. I know that if I were given the chance I would.
thank you for your time. - Michael

If it's not to late (this is the first chance I've had to write this), I'd
like to show my supposrt for Jason Hudson as APO OI president.  Over the
past year (since he pledged), Jason has been actively involved in many of
the projects that we do.  He is willing to listen to others, but I feel
that he would be able to step in and resolve a dispute and keep brother
meetings moving without a lot of side conversation.  I hope you consider
this in your discussion.
