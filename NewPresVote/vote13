Subject: Nomination

	I would like to nominate myself for the posistion of President.
This nomination does not mean that no one else could do the job.  It just
means that I would like the opportunity to lead our chapter of APO.  I am
an Eagle Scout and was Senior Patrol Leader of my Boy Scout Troop, so I
know what it takes to lead a group in service and fellowship.  I feel as
if I have a good relationship with most of the brothers, and that I am
easy going and easy to talk to.  I am enthuisastic and committed to the
ideals of Alpha Phi Omega and hope that you consider me for your
president.
