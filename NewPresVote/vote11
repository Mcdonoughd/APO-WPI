Hello.
	I would like to recommend Jimmy Cook for President of APO. Jimmy and I are
both brothers of Phi Sigma Kappa. At Phi Sig we have three cardinal
principles, the promotion of Brotherhood, the stimulation of Scholarship,
and the development of Character.  Jimmy is someone that exemplifies all
three of these principles.  APO has three principles as well, Leadership,
Friendship and Service.  I don't know how well I can convince you that Jimmy
exemplifies Friendship, other than that he is one of my best friends at WPI,
but I think I can convince you that he exemplifies Leadership and Service.
	Jimmy is an Eagle Scout and he was President of his National Honor Society
in high school.  At Phi Sig he was Philanthropy Chairman last spring and is
currently our House Manager.  In the two positions that I have seen Jimmy
hold he has taken a position and done his best to make it more than what it
was.  Service has become a more important part of Phi Sig because of what
Jimmy did.  I know Jimmy as someone who loves to be of service.  In the
leadership positions that I have seen him in he has done an excellent job.
Jimmy is, in my opinion, the best person to have as president of this
chapter.

Thank you.

YiLFS,
	Steve Millet
