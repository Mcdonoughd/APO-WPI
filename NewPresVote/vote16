Subject: Re: ExeComm

I was just about to nominated Vishnu....he's beena  brother for at least a
semester, he was on execom for one term already and he has proven to be
very neutral.  Also, having been a brother of APO for a semester has given
him a chance to see how this brotherhood is.  I am aware that the past
spring class brings with them a lot of leadership experience from other
organizations, but as we all know, that even our first semester as
brothers, we are still lerning about APO and what it is.  And even though
taking over for a term as a new brother for an officer has been down, it
is different than taking over for the president.  Also, yes, Matthew
Erickson became SVP his first semester as a brother, but he is very
admitly against it because he would never want anyone else to be put in
that same position again; that's just too much to handle.  So, out of the
current brothers, Vishnu is probably the best choice we have.
