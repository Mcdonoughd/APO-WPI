i am writing this in regards to the presidential nominations that are
quickly approaching. i read the nomination that kate manning sent in for
jimmy cook and i believe that she is completely and utterly correct as to
his suitability for the job. i would like to nominate him as well, with
my reasons being the same as those that kate sent in. i think that her
point about our want of a new face (a sophmore, someone young), that does
not have connections within the chapter is totally right; it is one of
the most important reasons that i am nominating jimmy. the other reasons
that kate mentioned, i concur with. please elect jimmy cook as president.
