I would like to nominate Jimmy Cook for the position of President.  I think
that he has fresh ideas and a less jaded outlook on what should be done
within execcom.  Quite simply i think he would go out of his way to protect
the interest of the brothers and because of this he would be a fantastic
choice.  He has experience and the potential to be a great motivator and
leader.

 I hope he gets the chance to prove it.

Erin
