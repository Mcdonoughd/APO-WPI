Subject: Nomination



Hello - I would like to nominate vishnu pande for the off ice of
president.  I feel he would be a good person for the job becuase of many
reasons.

My first reason is that I nknow that prior to this event, (during this
summer) he had discussed running for president in b-term and had done
research into the office.  This shows not only interst, but initiative,
which I believe is an important quatlity.  

Second, Vishnu sat on execcomm during the D99 term as a pre-tem officer.
This experience gave him a chance to see not only how an exxecomm
functions but how THIS exxecomm functions as a group and the dynamics
therin.  

Thirdly, Vishnu has shown leadership experience in the pas by being SVP
(check on that?) of his pledge class, and worked on several committees for
SEVERAL projects since he has become a brother.  

Fourth - as a brother who pledged over a year ago, he knows what goes on
during the fall (bylay review, voting, service auction) and with this
familiarity he will need less assistance from the other officers to help
oversee these projects, which in turns let's the officers have more time
with their own projects/events.  

Fifth, He is a brother who attended exxeccom not only before he was a
protem officer, but also after.  THis shows that he, as a brother, is
concerned with apo, this brotherhood, and knows that he can make a
differnece by being active.  In addition to regularly attending exxeccom,
I also see him at sercommand other commitee meetings, offereing help
wherever he can, never taking on too much that he can't handle but always
coming through when promises are made, which most of the time is more
important than taking on 50 things.  

I feel Vishu Pandey would make a wonderful pre-tem president due to his
past xperiences and with his interest expresed both before and after this
event.  

Thank you.

the other one looks like an
immature moron.
