Subject: New President

Jimmy Cook expressed his interest to me in being the new president until
the elections next term and I feel that he would make an excellent
president.  I have known him since our first day at W.P.I and was one of
his best friends freshman year, so I feel I can vouch for his dedication
to a job.  I think he did an excellent job as APO pledge president, as I
did attend almost all the pledge meetings.  He is not afraid to get things
done if they need to be. And most importantly is a good person. Although
he was just initiated into APO, he is already a junior and mature enough
to handle this position.
	He is an Eagle Scout and a very hard worker.  If he was president,
I would feel very confident that things under him would be run as
smoothly as possible, which is one thing this fraternity needs.
If we were to have a general vote for a new president, he would be my
choice without fail.

					Thank you,
