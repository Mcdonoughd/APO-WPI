Subject: pres nomination

  As a brother of Alpha Phi Omega I would like to nominated Jason Hudson
for the role of President.  I feel that he has the insiration and
leadership skills necessary for this job.  Also, he has the heart for the
priciples of the organization and would lead the brotherhood and uncomming
pledges into a mode of service, leadership, and friendship.

Thank You
Estelle M Houde
