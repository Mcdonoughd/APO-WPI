My reccommendation, since everyone nominated would not have the
experience necessary to do the job to the standards I think it needs to be
heald I would put my money on Jimmy as he needs the experience. I have a
feeling we will be electing him to the rank of President later this year.
It would be nice to give him a quick heads up into the world of APO
politics now. not the best reccommendation ever written, but since I
just found out the nominees by email today and since I have had no chance
to talk with the people, and this is the best I could do.
