Subject: Nomination

Dear executive Committee

	With great pride I would like to nominate Jason Hudson for the
pssition of president.  I believe that Hudson more than meets the
qualifications that an APO president should have.  As an Eagle scout
Hudson has been committed to the principles of APO for a good portion of
his life.  In addition to this he has a lot of leadership experience at
WPI.  This experience comes primarlily from being an RA and also from
taking "unsung" leadership roles in APO.  From the moment Hudson started
pledging he began working as a behind the scenes leader.  .  He has really
shown that he knows not only how to get things done but how to listen and
get others involved.  I can think of countless times when Hudson has
worked to get members of the brotherhood pumped for a particular event.  

	To come into the possition of president neer the end of a term
takes a particularly strong individual.  Someone who is not going to sit
idle for even a moment.  Hudson is that type of person.  He will workright
from the moment he takes office.  

	Hudson is an inovative individual with many ideas about how to
work for the brotherhood, but more importantly he has a real heart to
serve and listen to the brotherhood.  I highly recomend Hudson for the
possition of president.

Your brother
Matthew
