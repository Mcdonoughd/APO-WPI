I know it is late to be making recommendations, but I felt like writing this
anyways...

Although I think all 3 candidates would make excellent presidents, I have
the most faith in Hudson.

He is always upbeat and after talking to him, I sincerely feel that he
really would like to be president and is willing to put in everything it
takes to do a good job.  Hudson is at all the brother meetings, and shows up
to things most people don't (like the Rush fellowship event yesterday!!!)
Vishnu did show up for that as well, by the way...

Hudson is very enthusiastic about APO, and I believe he would be a good
moderator for meetings.  For these reasons, I would like Hudson to be our
next president.
