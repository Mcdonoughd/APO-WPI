Subject: Nomination


	I would also like to give a nomination for Jimmy Cook.  Though
there are several reasons why I and many others feel Jimmy would do an
excellent job, I will give the most important reason.  Jimmy proved his
ability to serve as president as he was the pledge class president. I
realize serving as the president of the entire fraternity is a much
greater responsibility, I am sure Jimmy can handle this.  In the word
capable I refer to many things.  He is capable of keeping patience and 
listening to the group as a whole.  He is capable of learning what he
does not know and admitting to the things he does not know.  He can calm
a group with all seriourness or break them into laughter.  He knows how
far to take a joke and when it is out of line.  He has the will to find
the potential of APO and bring it out in all of us.  He can make you
smile or shut you up, he is brief and to the point, and he is competent
to hold a role of authority.
	Jimmy is not the person in our fraternity who knows the most about
it's history or the most about the laws.  Though Jimmy is someone who will
learn and commit to whatever is asked of him. This is something he wants
to do, not any of us are throwing upon him. We need a change and I know he
is the change we require.  I believe he is the best choice for our pledge
class president. 

Thank you, Katie Gagnon
