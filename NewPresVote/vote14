Hi,

	I was thinking about it for a while and finally decided that I
want to run for president of APO. I've been in APO for about a year now
and served as Corresponding Secretary for the final term of last year. I
do have a lot of different ideas for helping to get APO back on its feet
but, admittedly, they will take time. I'm not involved as an officer of
any other organization so APO would have my full attention. I don't think
badly of any brothers so there would be no "prejudice" and I obviously
would not take sides in a disagreement. I have served on Exec Comm so I
know how the process works. Please consider me as a candidate in the
deciding process. Thank You.

Sincerely,

Vishnu Pandey

of all that gives me the chills."
