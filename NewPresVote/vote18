Subject: Re: ExeComm

I meant to write my recommendation a long time ago, sorry I didn't. 
I talked to Mike Bruno about the position.  I think he would be an IDEAL
person for the temporary president.  He has been the president before and
he knows what needs to be done.  He could step in seamlessly and carry the
chapter through the term.
He thought it would be better to allow one of the other Brothers take the
responsibility.  I don't think he would be opposed to the position though.
>From my experience with Jimmy, he is an excellent person, but can be a bit
grating at times.  He leads well when he wants to/needs to.
Vishnu is also a great person, but he can let people walk over him.  He
also doesn't speak very louldly, and a stronger person would be a better
choice.
Hudson is also a wonderful guy, with a strong, commanding charisma about
him.  He is down to earth, yet has good vision.  However he does have the
comical and carefree aire about him. 
I would love to take the position, but I cannot because of time and other
things. 
Best of luck in your decision.   Each of the candidates has strengths and
weaknesses.  Choose well!
Thank you for your time.
-Brian
ps. I assume this as given, but I would like confidentiality in my
statements above!  Thanks :)
